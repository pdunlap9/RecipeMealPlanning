1    Make an ingredients list (where do I put that?)
    get/set 
        Quantity
        Measurement
        Item
    ADD to ingredient list
    ingredient list would be part of recipe controller

    How would that show up on database? Would that be its own table?

2    On the view, make a form where the user can dynamically add more rows for ingredients to add


3    How do I allow users to add photos? I have the form but how
